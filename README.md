The R20 Regulation Internal Marks Calculator is a lightweight and user-friendly web application developed for students of Bapatla Engineering College to accurately compute their internal marks based on the official R20 academic regulations.
The tool allows students to enter their AAT-1, AAT-2, MID-1, and MID-2 marks and instantly calculates:

The average AAT score

The weighted MID marks as per R20 formula
(Best MID × 0.43 + Second MID × 0.14)

The final internal marks (out of 30)

Automatic pass/fail status based on minimum required marks

Suggestions for minimum marks needed in AAT-2 or MID-2 to qualify

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application includes real-time validation ensuring:

AAT values are within 0–10

MID values are within 0–35

Internal marks never exceed 30

Invalid inputs are flagged immediately

This project helps students avoid manual calculation errors and provides a reliable way to track academic performance as per BEC’s R20 regulation structure.
